# Self Driving-Tensorflow 2.0
Thanks to Sully Chen for the autopilot dataset. https://github.com/SullyChen/driving-datasets
The approach to predict steering angle using CNN is based on paper "End to End Learning for Self-Driving Cars" from Nvidia in 2016 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.07316.pdf

### What makes this Selfdriving project better then others.

- [x] Interactive Colab Notebook which any one can try.
- [x] Based on latest Tensorflow 2. 
- [x] Dataset augmentation to balance the labels.
- [x] Configure the dataset for performance using cache() and prefetch()
